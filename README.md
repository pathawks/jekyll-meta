# jekyll-meta  
## Collection of known Jekyll post metadata

This project aims to be a central database of YAML metadata used on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) sites.

There is a lot of "reinventing the wheel" in the Jekyll ecosystem; perhaps documenting existing solutions will save some future effort by allowing developers to reuse what already exists.
